LLM for Generating Commit Messages

When I am working on a project, I often find it challenging to come up with clear and concise commit messages that accurately describe the changes I've made. OftenI would spend a lot of time thinking about how to phrase my commit messages, which can be frustrating and time-consuming.

To solve this problem, I decided to create a tool that uses Gemini LLM to generate commit messages based on the changes I've made in my code. The tool analyzes the diff of my changes and generates a commit message that accurately reflects the changes.

## Features

I am still figuring out the features, Will update soon.
